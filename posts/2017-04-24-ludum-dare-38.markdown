title: Ludum Dare 38
---
This past weekend, I participated in [Ludum Dare 38](http://ludumdare.com/compo/) with [Kyle Sammons](https://github.com/centip3de), a friend of mine. Kyle handled the programming while I took on some of the creative aspects. The "story" revolves around a child hopping between paintings, solving puzzles, and jumping between platforms.

I figured it would be fun to break out of my comfort zone and try my hand at [pixel art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_art) since I spend most of my time programming. While I didn't do all of the art for the game, there was enough to give me main credit. One amusing symptom is that you can infer the order in which I drew the art &mdash; tiles designed at the end are _slightly_ more intricate than what I started with.

If you'd like to give the game a shot, [it's available here](https://homolo.gy/secret).
